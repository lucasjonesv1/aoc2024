# Advent of Code 2024
Advent of Code 2024 solutions. All in python, trying to use stuff available in the standard library.

Almost guranteed to frustrate, and not be pythonic but hey ho :) or should I say ho ho ho?

Shoutout to [wim.glenn](https://pypi.org/user/wim.glenn/) and the [aocd](https://pypi.org/project/advent-of-code-data/) package to save reading files and copy/pasting data every day!
